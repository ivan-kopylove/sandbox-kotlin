# sandbox-kotlin

The collection of atomic, focused and isolated examples to try out different approaches using hand-on mode.

Unlike classical hierarchy, the package structure follows the [faceted classification](https://ivan-kopylove.github.io/3838305e-47f6-48d7-9c95-31ec07e733e7).

The number of categories grow over time, so the faceted classification helps me to focus on a business rather on struggling through existing package structure.
